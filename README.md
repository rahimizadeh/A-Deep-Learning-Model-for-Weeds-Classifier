Please read the following paper that implements Lithology microscopic image classification on Weeds Dataset using transfer learning. The paper formulates the classification task to a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) scheme and proposed a Fine-Tuned Aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (FTA-FTL).

# Deep-Transfer-Learning-for-Weeds-Classifier
A dataset for 12 weed species including Anthemis arvensis, Malva Sylvestris, Oxalis corniculata, Prosopis farcta, Tribulus terrestris, Cuscuta, Euphorbia helioscopia, Urtica dioica, Artemisia annua, Phragmites australis, Anchusa italica Retz, and Setaria; is provided and several Deep Learning pre-trained models are utilized for the multi-class classification task.
